# Comparative-Analysis-of-Mental-Health-Impact-by-Demographics
As work environments and societal expectations evolve, mental health has become an increasingly prominent concern. This project explored how demographic factors—age, gender, job role, and work location (onsite, hybrid, remote)—affected mental health in remote work settings. Using a dataset on mental health conditions among remote workers, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted, including data cleaning, summary statistics, and visualizations, to identify trends and correlations.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization
### Tasks Involved:
Loading the dataset and cleaning any missing or inconsistent data.

Generating summary statistics for numerical columns.

Visualizing the distributions of key columns using histograms, box plots, and bar charts.

Creating correlation heat maps to find relationships between numerical variables.

Visualizing the proportion of respondents experiencing mental health challenges.

## Analysis of Mental Health Impact by Demographics
### Tasks involved:
Segmenting the dataset by different demographic columns (i.e., age groups, gender).

Calculating the average mental health scores or other relevant metrics for each group.

Using box plots and bar charts to compare mental health impact across groups.

Analysing if remote work has different impacts on mental health for different demographics using “groupby” and aggregation functions
